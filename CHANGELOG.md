# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `visual` reads Adam7-interlaced PNGs, with the same 8- and 16-bit colour types as plain PNGs (#10).
- `visual` reads 16-bit PNGs too (grey, RGB, RGBA); they are compared at 8 bits, the high byte of each sample (#1).
- `logs` reads `adb logcat` dumps: the threadtime prefix is stripped and only the Unity tag is counted (#3).
- `bench/live.py --scenario NAME` runs a single scenario (#2).

## 0.1.2 (2026-11-05)

- README only: the MCP Registry name is `io.github.RizgarOzan/playcal`, with the GitHub login's case. 0.1.1 shipped it lowercase, so the registry could not match the PyPI package. No code change.

## 0.1.1 (2026-11-05)

- `loop run`: the ready check before the write is one `editor status` call now, with the `--diff` snapshot in the same batch, instead of two `unity status` polls and a separate read. A quiet write is 3 CLI calls instead of 4 (idle write ~7 s live, was ~15 s; bad value ~5 s, was ~11 s). The polls stay as the fallback when the Editor is busy, silent, or about to reload.
- Listed in the MCP Registry as `io.github.RizgarOzan/playcal`; the release workflow publishes `server.json` after PyPI.

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-05)

First public release. Everything here runs without Unity except `loop`, `observe`, `replay`, `doctor`'s Editor checks and the Unity SDK; those were checked on a live Unity 6000.3 Editor with Pipeline 0.10.0-exp.1.

- `loop`: settle, run one Editor command, settle again, read back and assert, one JSON digest with `fault: infra|task`. After a write that starts no reload, one `job batch` call checks `editor status` and does the read-back, so a write is 4 CLI calls instead of 6 (idle write ~15 s live, was ~24 s). `--diff` no longer reports the request echo as a change.
- `logs`, `query`, `snap`, `checkpoint`, `lock`, `doctor`.
- `observe`: press Play, run the game a few seconds, report console errors, `--expect` checks and the scene diff; a Game view screenshot only when the run goes red. Reads go through `job batch` and Play Mode is checked with `editor status`, so a clean run is 7 CLI calls (~33 s live) instead of 16 (~70 s); `played_ms` says how long the game really ran.
- `replay`: record input through the SDK, play it back with a fixed frame rate and seed, report the first frame where the marks differ; stop on a frame and step from there.
- `baseline` (perf and memory), `visual` (screenshot gate), `tests` (flaky history, quarantine, affected test assemblies).
- `ingest`, `report`, `calibrate`: an event schema with no room for personal data, per-level pass rates with Wilson intervals, and human pass-rate predictions from bot runs.
- `playcal mcp` (stdio MCP server) and `playcal skill` (SKILL.md), both generated from the module registry.
- Unity SDK `com.playcal.sdk`: level events, paste-back result line, frame and memory recorder, screenshots, input recording and replay.
- `bench/sim.py` (scripted regression guard) and `bench/live.py` (naive CLI vs `loop` on a real Editor).
